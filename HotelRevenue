The database contains information about a hotel, like registration date, waiting time, duration of the stay, how many people, if they spent (and how much) on the hotel and many more information. The goal is to build work the data in a way it can be later used to create a
dashboard in PowerBI by answering the following questions:
Is hotel revenue growing? // Should the hotel increase the parking lot size? // What trends can be identified in the data?
